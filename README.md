### Testing the API Endpoints
You can test the API endpoints using Apollo Client at `/graphql`. Simply navigate to `http://localhost:yourport/graphql` in your web browser (replace `yourport` with the actual port number your server is running on).

```graphql
query {
  exampleQuery {

    field2
  }
